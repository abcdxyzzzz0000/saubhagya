# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements comprehensive internationalization (i18n) support for the Saubhagya application, enabling users to seamlessly switch between English and Hindi languages. The implementation will provide dynamic language switching with persistent user preferences, ensuring all UI components display content in the selected language without requiring page reloads.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to switch between English and Hindi languages using a toggle or dropdown in the navbar, so that I can use the application in my preferred language.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user visits the application THEN the system SHALL detect the browser's default language and set it as the initial language if supported, otherwise default to English
2. WHEN the user clicks the language switcher THEN the system SHALL immediately change all UI text to the selected language without page reload
3. WHEN the user selects a language THEN the system SHALL save the preference in localStorage for persistence across sessions
4. WHEN the user refreshes the page or reopens the app THEN the system SHALL load and apply the previously selected language from localStorage

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a centralized translation system with JSON files, so that I can easily manage and maintain translations for both languages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN translations are needed THEN the system SHALL use separate JSON files (en.json for English, hi.json for Hindi) stored in a locales directory
2. WHEN a translation key is requested THEN the system SHALL return the appropriate text based on the current language setting
3. WHEN a translation key is missing THEN the system SHALL fallback to the English version and log a warning
4. WHEN new content is added THEN developers SHALL be able to add translation keys without modifying component code

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want all text content throughout the application to be translated, so that I have a consistent experience in my chosen language.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the language is changed THEN all static text in navigation menus SHALL be translated
2. WHEN the language is changed THEN all page titles, headings, and body text SHALL be translated
3. WHEN the language is changed THEN all button labels and form elements SHALL be translated
4. WHEN the language is changed THEN all error messages and notifications SHALL be translated
5. WHEN the language is changed THEN all card content and descriptions SHALL be translated

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user viewing Hindi content, I want proper font support and layout handling, so that Hindi text displays correctly and remains readable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Hindi is selected THEN the system SHALL use fonts that properly support Devanagari script
2. WHEN Hindi text is displayed THEN the layout SHALL accommodate different text lengths without breaking
3. WHEN Hindi is active THEN text alignment and spacing SHALL remain visually appealing
4. WHEN switching languages THEN UI components SHALL resize gracefully to accommodate text length differences

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user on any device, I want the language switcher to work seamlessly across desktop and mobile, so that I can change languages regardless of my device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using desktop THEN the language switcher SHALL be easily accessible in the navbar
2. WHEN using mobile THEN the language switcher SHALL be accessible in the mobile menu
3. WHEN switching languages on any device THEN the change SHALL apply immediately across all components
4. WHEN the screen size changes THEN the language switcher SHALL remain functional and accessible

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a React hook for translations, so that I can easily implement i18n in any component throughout the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a component needs translations THEN it SHALL use a useTranslation hook to access translation functions
2. WHEN the language changes THEN all components using the hook SHALL automatically re-render with new translations
3. WHEN implementing translations THEN the hook SHALL provide a simple t() function for key-based translation
4. WHEN debugging THEN the hook SHALL provide clear error messages for missing translation keys
