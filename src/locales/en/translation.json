        "details": "By properly processing cattle dung through anaerobic digestion, you prevent uncontrolled methane release - a greenhouse gas 25 times more potent than CO₂. Each ton of dung you supply prevents approximately 25kg of methane emissions, equivalent to taking 1.5 cars off roads for a year. This also eliminates groundwater contamination, reduces fly and mosquito breeding, and improves village sanitation. The CBG produced replaces fossil fuels, supporting India's renewable energy targets. The digestate byproduct returned to you is nutrient-rich organic fertilizer, reducing chemical fertilizer costs by 20-30% while improving soil health for better crop yields."
